[Star Getter](http://canlas.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/star-getter/)

I have a bad habit of starring repos that I think are cool or that would be useful and never use those repos! So I made Star Getter to randomly pick a repo using the github public api and based on what repo is picked I will build a mini project.

By default github api is using my username but to change that just add the username of your choice into the input field. The other default is how many randomly selected repos are returned (1 is the default);
